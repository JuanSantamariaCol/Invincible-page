                <p class=" m-4 descrip-letters text-justify">Mark Grayson is teenage superhero Invincible. 
                    He was a normal high school senior with a normal part-time job and otherwise normal life, except
                    his father Nolan is the superhero Omni-Man, the most powerful superhero on the planet. At the age of 17,
                    Mark begins to display superpowers, which come from his father being a member of the Viltrumite race, who,
                    according to Nolan, pioneer the galaxy on a mission of benevolence and enlightenment.
                    As Invincible, Mark begins working as a superhero, with his father acting as his mentor,
                    and meeting other heroes (including Robot, Rex Splode, Dupli-Kate and Atom Eve), discovering that his Physics 
                    teacher has been turning his students into human bombs, to foiling a plan by the Mauler Twins to make an army of robots.
                    Meanwhile, Omni-Man is kidnapped by aliens, taken to another dimension, but returns after what seems to be only a few days,
                    but was actually eight months to him.
